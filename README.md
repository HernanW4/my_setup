# My Setup

This repo will hold all of my config setup. Is not much but I don't want 
to have to install every single thing every time I'm at a new workstation. 

Is mainly just to hold stuff for me, you are welcomed to use it for inspiration,
I sure did with other examples out there. 

# Note
For me and you.

There are a few things you would need to install, things I'm too lazy to mention.
The very basic ones is **fish**, **tmux** and **tmuxifier**.

I will not be making a guide on how to install all of this because I'm lazy. 
So good luck :)
